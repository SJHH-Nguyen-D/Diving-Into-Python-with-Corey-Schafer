# My Designated Learning, Exploration, and Experimentation Repo

## Preface

This repo is about going through several of Corey Schafer's deeper dive into python playlists on youtube for various topics. It is supposed to deepen my understanding of the various neat functions that python has to offer that I haven't learned yet and best practices on doing new things in python.

The topics in this repo touch upon a variety of domains and a folder is created for each of the topics I touched on. This serves as a code journal for my journey into learning on advanced topics in programming.

## To-Learn

This list covers some of the subject areas that I've been meaning to learn when it comes to programming in Python and can be organized into subjects that I want to learn about with near-immediate applicability, subjects considered "would-be useful in the future" and subjects that I've gone out to learn about (if only at a "superficial" level).

### Immediate

* setup.py files and packaging
* tracking pixels
* ML experimentation organizaton frameworks
* minimum viable test suite
* mocking external dependencies/APIs
* 

### Future

* async
* multiprocessing
* streaming facial recognition
* garbage collection
* cython / cpython

### Completed

* ~~unit testing~~
* ~~integration testing~~
* ~~file structure for testing~~
* ~~test runners in unittest, pytest, nose2~~
* ~~linting with flake8~~
* ~~formating with black~~
* ~~test assertions with unittest~~
* ~~testing in different environments with tox~~
* ~~CI/CD with travis-ci~~
* ~~security detailing with bandit~~
* ~~threading, multitasking, multithreading~~
* ~~mocking~~
