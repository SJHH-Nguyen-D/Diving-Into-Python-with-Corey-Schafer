# About this Repo

This repo is about going through several of Corey Schafer's deeper dive into python playlists on youtube for various topics. It is supposed to deepen my understanding of the various neat functions that python has to offer that I haven't learned yet and best practices on doing new things in python.

I think Corey does a fantastic job of teaching the material and the scripts in this repo are just me following along with the video, getting a hang of it and creating my own practice examples.
